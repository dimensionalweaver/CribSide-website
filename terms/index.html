      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

      <h2>Agreement</h2>
      <p>By downloading, installing, or using Cribside ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>Cribside grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App on Apple devices you own or control, subject to the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions. This license is governed by Apple's Licensed Application End User License Agreement (EULA), available at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" rel="noopener noreferrer">apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula</a>.</p>

      <h2>Intended Use</h2>
      <p>Cribside is designed as a supplemental baby monitoring tool. It is not a medical device and should not be relied upon as the sole means of monitoring a child. Always follow safe sleep guidelines and never use any baby monitor as a substitute for direct supervision.</p>

      <h2>Local Network Only</h2>
      <p>Cribside operates exclusively over your local WiFi network. The App requires that all devices be connected to the same network. Performance depends on your network conditions, device capabilities, and environment. Cribside does not guarantee uninterrupted service.</p>

      <h2>No Warranty</h2>
      <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet your specific requirements.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Cribside and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenue, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>Cribside, including its name, logo, design, and code, is the intellectual property of its developer. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App or its content.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms of Use from time to time. The updated version will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
