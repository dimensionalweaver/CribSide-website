      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

      <p><strong>The short version:</strong> Cribside does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. Period.</p>

      <h2>No data collection</h2>
      <p>Cribside does not collect any information from you or your devices. There are no analytics, no crash reporting services, no advertising frameworks, and no third-party SDKs that transmit data. We don't know who you are, how often you use the app, or anything about your baby.</p>

      <h2>No accounts</h2>
      <p>Cribside does not require or offer account creation. There is no email address, no password, no username, and no sign-in process. You download the app and use it.</p>

      <h2>No servers</h2>
      <p>Cribside has no server infrastructure. There is no cloud. Audio and video streams travel directly between your devices over your local WiFi network. Data physically cannot leave your home network because there is no server to send it to.</p>

      <h2>No internet required</h2>
      <p>Cribside operates entirely on your local network. It does not require an internet connection to function. The app never contacts external servers for any reason.</p>

      <h2>Camera and microphone</h2>
      <p>Cribside requests access to your device's camera and microphone to provide baby monitoring functionality. This audio and video is streamed only to other devices on your local WiFi network running Cribside. It is never recorded to disk, never transmitted over the internet, and never accessible to anyone outside your network.</p>

      <h2>Local network access</h2>
      <p>Cribside requests local network permission to discover and connect to other devices running Cribside on your WiFi network. This uses Apple's Bonjour protocol. No data leaves your local network.</p>

      <h2>Encryption</h2>
      <p>All audio and video streams between devices are encrypted using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) with AES-256-GCM encryption. Even on your local network, streams are protected.</p>

      <h2>Purchases</h2>
      <p>Cribside is a one-time purchase through the Apple App Store. The transaction is handled entirely by Apple. Cribside never sees your payment information, Apple ID, or any purchase details.</p>

      <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
      <p>Because Cribside collects no data whatsoever, there is no children's data to protect. The app is fully compliant with COPPA, GDPR, and all applicable children's privacy regulations by virtue of collecting nothing.</p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>If this privacy policy ever changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date. Given the architecture of Cribside, we do not anticipate this policy will ever need to change. There is nothing to collect.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
