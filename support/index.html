      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does Cribside work?</h3>
        <p>Cribside turns your Apple devices into a baby monitor. One device acts as the Monitor (camera + microphone near the baby) and other devices act as Receivers (parent watches and listens). Everything streams directly over your local WiFi network.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What devices do I need?</h3>
        <p>You need at least two Apple devices: one for the Monitor and one for the Receiver. Cribside works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac running iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS 14 and later.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do both devices need to be on the same WiFi?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Both the Monitor and Receiver devices must be connected to the same WiFi network. Cribside streams directly between devices over your local network and does not use the internet.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need an internet connection?</h3>
        <p>No. Cribside works entirely over your local WiFi network. It does not require an internet connection. You can even use it with a Personal Hotspot in a hotel room or cabin.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Setup &amp; Connection</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I pair devices?</h3>
        <p>On the Monitor device, tap "Start Monitor." A 4-digit PIN will appear on screen. On your Receiver device, the Monitor will appear in the discovery list. Tap it and enter the PIN to connect.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can multiple people watch at once?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Up to 5 Receiver devices can connect to a single Monitor at the same time. Both parents can watch from different rooms or devices.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>The Receiver can't find the Monitor. What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network. Check that the Monitor is running and showing a PIN. Try toggling WiFi off and on. If you're on a corporate or public network, local network discovery may be blocked by the network administrator.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Audio &amp; Video</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I listen in the background?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Audio continues to play when you switch to another app or lock your screen. You'll hear your baby even while using other apps.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is sound detection?</h3>
        <p>Cribside monitors the audio level from the nursery and can alert you when it detects sounds above a threshold you set. This helps you know when your baby is stirring, fussing, or crying.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Privacy &amp; Security</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my video sent to the cloud?</h3>
        <p>No. Cribside has no cloud servers. Video and audio stream directly between your devices over your WiFi. Nothing ever leaves your home network. There is no server to send it to.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is the stream encrypted?</h3>
        <p>Yes. All streams are encrypted with DTLS using AES-256-GCM. Even on your own network, your data is protected.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does Cribside collect any data?</h3>
        <p>No. Cribside collects zero data. No analytics, no crash reports, no tracking. See our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Purchasing</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a subscription?</h3>
        <p>No. Cribside is a one-time purchase of $4.99. Every feature is included. There are no subscriptions, no in-app purchases, and no ads.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use it on all my devices?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Your purchase applies to your Apple ID. Download Cribside on any iPhone, iPad, or Mac signed in with the same Apple ID at no extra cost.</p>
